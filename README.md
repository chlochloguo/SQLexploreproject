This project analyzes COVID-19 cases and vaccinations using SQL and Python.  

## Files
- `SQL_Project.ipynb` → Main notebook with SQL queries and analysis  
- `CovidDeaths (3).xlsx' 'CovidVacciations.xlsx` → cleaned data  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab  
2. Install required libraries

## Results
- total cases vs total deaths,  shows the likelihood of dying if you contract COVID in your country
- total cases vs population, shows what percentage of the population got COVID
- countries with the highest infection rate compared to population
- countries with the highest death count per population
- continents with the highest death count
- global numbers
- total population vs vaccinations
- practice using CTE, Temp table, view
